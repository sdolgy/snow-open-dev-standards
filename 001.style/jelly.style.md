Open Development Standards for Jelly [ServiceNow] -- Style Guide
================================================================

Introduction
------------
As per [Apache Jelly website](http://commons.apache.org/jelly/):  

> Jelly is a tool for turning XML into executable code. So Jelly is a Java and XML based scripting and processing engine. Jelly can be used as a more flexible and powerful front end to Ant such as in the Maven project, as a testing framework such as JellyUnit, in an intergration or workflow system such as werkflow or as a page templating system inside engines like Cocoon.  

Specific to the [Service Now](http://www.service-now.com/) platform: 

> Apache's Jelly syntax is used to render forms, lists, UI Pages, and many other things rendered in ServiceNow. With Jelly, logic can be embedded within static content and computed values may be inserted into the static content.
